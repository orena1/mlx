We're going to be looking at some papers part of the reading list for 6.S897/HST.S53: Machine Learning for Healthcare taught at MIT by Professor David Sontag.

We'll cover two papers in the category of "Supervised learning for risk stratification".

# In a nutshell
The first paper we'll take a look at is *[Big Data In Health Care: Using Analytics To Identify And Manage High-Risk And High-Cost Patients (2014)](http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/33/7/1123.full).

The paper addresses the problem of high costs of healthcare, identifying opportunities to reduce costs through the use of predictive systems: "software tools that allow the
stratification of risk to predict an outcome". The paper looks at six opportunities whether clinical analytics is likely beneficial:
- High-cost patients: Management will be much more cost-effective if interventions can be precisely tailored to a patientâ€™s specific problems. If high-risk and low-risk patients can be identified, a better reallocation of resources can follow.
- Readmissions: Healthcare orgs should use algorithms to "predict who is likely to be readmitted to the hospital", and patient-specific monitoring once they're discharged to intervene if necessary.
- Triage (assigning degrees of urgency to patients): Use patient data to anticipate risk, and combine with routinely collected physiological measurements to make accurate assesements.
- Decompensation (worsenining of patient condition): Continuous monitoring of multiple data streams (is the patient moving, ECG, oxygen) combined with real-time alert systems.
- Adverse events: Similar to decompensation; applications to renal failure, infection, and adverse drug events.
- Diseases Affecting Multiple Organ Systems: Clinical data networks and access to longitudinal records (history of patient visits) can improve patient care.
